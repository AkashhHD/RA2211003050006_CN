Network Design and Configuration Report

1. Topology Design:

Objective: Design a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer to connect multiple computers and establish WAN connectivity.

LAN Configuration:

Devices: At least 10 computers connected to switches.
Setup: Utilize at least 2 switches to manage the LAN.
WAN Configuration:

Devices: Connect the LAN network to another network using at least 2 routers.
Setup: Ensure proper configuration for WAN connectivity between different networks.
2. Network Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer:

Adding Devices:

Computers: Place and connect 10 to 15 computers within the network.
Switches: Incorporate a minimum of 2 switches to manage LAN traffic.
Routers: Add at least 2 routers to facilitate WAN connectivity.
Configuring IP Addresses:

Computers: Assign unique IP addresses to each computer within the LAN.
Routers: Configure router interfaces with appropriate IP addresses.
Routing: Set up routing protocols or static routes as necessary to enable communication between networks.
3. Configuration Steps:

LAN Configuration:

Connect Computers: Link all computers to the switches.
Assign IP Addresses: Configure IP addresses on each computer to ensure proper network communication.
Connect Switches: Interconnect the switches to expand the LAN as needed.
WAN Configuration:

Connect Routers: Link the routers to each other to establish WAN connections.
Configure Router Interfaces: Set IP addresses for router interfaces to facilitate network routing.
Set Up Routing: Implement static or dynamic routing to ensure that the LANs can communicate with each other through the WAN.
4. Simulation:

Message Transmission:

Simulation Mode: Use Cisco Packet Tracerâ€™s simulation mode to test network functionality.
Send a Message: Configure and send a message from a computer in one network to a computer in another network.
Verify Transmission: Capture and confirm the successful transmission of the message to ensure proper network setup and connectivity.
